## üöÄ Quick start

1. **Prerequisites**

    To clone this repository to your computer and successfully complete this quick start, you will need to have the following installed locally:

    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

    *Installation directions are beyond the scope of this document.  Instead, search [Google](http://google.com).  Installing these two packages has been written about ad-nauseum.*

1.  **Clone this site.**

    From a terminal (or GitBash for Windows users), run the following command:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/j-651/spoonriver.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the repository's root directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd spoonriver/
    yarn install
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `spoonriver` directory in your code editor of choice and edit any file of your choosing. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yarn.lock

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm/yarn packages) are automatically installed.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

1.  **`.prettierignore`** (See `.prettierrc` below, first): This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) which specifies whiles files/directories should not be auto-formatted.

1.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

1.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

1.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

1.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

1. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

1. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

1. **`yarn.lock`** (See `package.json` above, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your yarn dependencies that were installed for this project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

## üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on their website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, it's recommended to start with their [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to their documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
